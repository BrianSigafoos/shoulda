Shoulda is for writing better Rails-specific tests using Minitest.

The `shoulda` gem doesn't contain any code of its own; it actually brings
behavior from two other gems:

* [Shoulda Context]
* [Shoulda Matchers]

See the READMEs for these projects for more information.

[Shoulda Context]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-context
[Shoulda Matchers]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers

## Usage

```ruby
class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should have_many(:posts)
  should_not allow_value("blah").for(:email)
end
```

Here, the `should` keyword comes from Shoulda Context; matchers (e.g.
`have_many`, `allow_value`) come from Shoulda Matchers.
